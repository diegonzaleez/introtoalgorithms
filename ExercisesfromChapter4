//Exercise 4-3
//Write a program to compute the area and perimeter of a rectangle with a width of three inches and a height of five inches. What changes must be made to the program so that it works for a rectangle with a width of 6.8 inches and a length of 2.3 inches?

5.
//Exercise 4-5
//Write a program that deliberately makes the following mistakes:
//• Prints a floating-point number using the %d conversion.
//• Prints an integer using the %f conversion.
//• Prints a character using the %d conversion.

#include <stdio.h>
